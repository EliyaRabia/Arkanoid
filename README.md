# Arkanoid
The Arkanoid game.
I implemented a version of the Arkanoid game, as part of the OOP course.
The game contains various levels with increasing difficulty, in a gui friendly platform.
I implemented the game with Java language using Intellij IDEA Ultimate IDE, using the following OOP principals:

- Polymorphism and inheritance.
- Usage of basic design patterns in OOP, such as Observer, Builder, etc.
- Usage of several generic collections and data structures such as linked lists and arraylists.
- Working with GUI.
